# Security & Privacy Rules (v1.0.0)

alwaysApply: true

## Directives

- Never log or print account numbers, card numbers, or PINs
- Mask sensitive data in error messages (show only last 4 digits)
- Do not commit sample data files with real account information
- Use environment variables for any API keys or credentials
- Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Never include personal financial data in test fixtures
- Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Avoid storing parsed data in temp directories without cleanup
- Use secure random for any ID generation (secrets module)
- Document all sensitive data fields in README

Never include or reveal: account_number, card_number, pin, password, ssn, tax_id

## Non-Goals

- Do not implement user authentication (out of scope)
- Do not implement network communication

## Example

```python
# ✅ GOOD: Masked logging
logger.info(f"Parsed account ****{account[-4:]}")

# ❌ BAD: Exposes full account
logger.info(f"Parsed account {account}")
